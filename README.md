# Disease-Diagnosis-using-Bayesian-Filter
Disease diagnosis, a pivotal aspect of patient care, stands to benefit immensely from the integration of cutting-edge technologies. In this project, the focus is specifically on the application of Bayesian filtering, a sophisticated probabilistic modelling approach, to estimate the likelihood of a patient having a particular disease given a set of symptoms from which the user can select the symptoms they are experiencing.
